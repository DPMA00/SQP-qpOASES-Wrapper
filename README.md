# SQP qpOASES Wrapper for Nonlinear Programming

This is a lightweight C++ testmodule developed with the objective of deepening my understanding of C++ OOP, and numerical optimal control.

As of now the module supports solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) with `qpoases`. 

Planned features include support for constrained problems, multiple shooting discretization for optimal control (and optional condensing).
